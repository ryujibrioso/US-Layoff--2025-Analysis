# US-Layoff--2025-Analysis
## Executive Summary:
In 2025, U.S. companies reported notable workforce reductions across multiple states and industries. Despite having accessible WARN data, key trends and regional impacts were not being fully analyzed. Using Python and Tableau, I built an interactive dashboard to identify which organizations and locations were most affected, as well as how layoffs changed throughout the year.

The analysis focused on:
- Which states saw the highest layoff counts
- Which companies were responsible for the most job losses
- How layoff activity trended month-by-month throughout 2025

This dashboard helps stakeholders quickly understand where workforce reductions are concentrated and how they are evolving, enabling workforce planning, risk assessment, and strategic decision-making.

## Business Problem
Organizations, analysts, and policymakers need to understand workforce disruption, but raw WARN data alone makes it difficult to:
- Identify where layoffs are most concentrated
- Spot companies with repeated or large-scale reductions
- Detect trends over time that may signal economic shifts or risk

Stakeholders want clarity on:
- Which states are most impacted?
- Which companies are driving the largest layoffs?
- Is layoff activity increasing or decreasing throughout 2025?
  
## Methodology
**Data Structure & Preparation**
- Imported WARN notice data (states, company, employee count, date, etc.)
- Cleaned missing values, standardized dates, normalized state & company naming
- Categorized monthly layoffs for trend analysis

**Analysis Techniques**
- Python (Pandas) for cleaning, grouping, aggregations
- Tableau to build a dashboard featuring:
  - Top States by Total Layoffs
  - Top 10 Companies by Layoff Count
  - Layoffs by Month (Trend Line)

**Key Metrics Analyzed**
- Total employees impacted
- Layoffs by state
- Layoffs by company
- Monthly layoff trends (Jan–Dec 2025)
  
**Analysis Techniques:**
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for cleaning, exploration, and visualization.
- Tableau dashboard to create an interactive, executive-friendly reporting experience.
- Metrics analyzed: views, impressions, CTR, watch time, revenue, net subscriber growth.
  
**Focus Areas:**
1. Regional Impact – Identify where layoffs are most concentrated.
2. Organizational Impact – Pinpoint companies with largest reductions.
3. Trend Analysis – Understand how layoffs progress through 2025.  
   
## Skills
- **Python:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, writing functions, data cleaning & visualization
- **Tableau:** Dashboard creation, interactive visualizations, KPI tracking
- **Data Analysis:** Trend analysis, correlation analysis, deriving actionable insights
- **Business Communication:** Turning raw data into insights & decision recommendations

## Results & Business Recommendations
**Regional Impact**
California consistently show higher layoff volume, indicating concentrated economic challenges or industry shifts.

**Trend Insights**
Monthly analysis shows whether layoffs are:
- Increasing → potential recessionary trend / hiring freeze indicators  
- Spiking in specific months → event-driven reductions or seasonal shifts
